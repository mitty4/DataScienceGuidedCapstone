    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_.

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

The `learning_curve` function does this conveniently."

Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "**A: 1** In order to verify the need for an ML algorithm, we check the forecasting capability of the average price by using a dummy regressor of mean from sklearn. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: (The coefficient of determination (R^2) of 0 tells that the prediction is the same as the values. An R^2 that is closer to -1 or to 1 means the residual variance is much greater or much less reliable than the actual results. R2 is a measure of variance and doesn’t uncover the actual difference in values vs predicted values, which is why we have MAE and MSE. These functions are available in sklearn. MAE is a very common metric.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We scaled the x data to have one magnitude as the data is recorded in different units. The data is now scaled with a mean of 0 with unit variance. Initially, when we make predictions and assess model performance by R^2, we see that the test set may be overfitted based on a 10% decrease in variance. Using the MAE, we can compare the estimated ticket price with $9 compared to the average estimate within $19, which is a much better prediction. We definitely can benefit from machine learning in this case! \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, with the use of pipelines, we streamline the process previously explained (replacing missing values, scaling the data and training a model so that we can compare filling the missing values by the mean and median). We see no significant difference between imputing with mean vs median but this may be because of overfitting due to arbitrarily fitting the model with every single column. In order to test a more intentional model, we use SelectKBest to find the best combination of variables. Now, our need is to find the best K variable but to use cross validation so that we are not simply creating a model that is test-data-specific. The cross validation mean 0.6327 is very similar to the test data set at 0.6376. The GridSearchCV function from sklearn allows us to find the best K, which ended up being 8. In the linear regression model, we see that vertical drop and snow making acres have the highest cause for increased ticket prices. \n",
    " \n",
    "The random forest model is created by first defining the pipeline and then using cross validation. We can see that the results are similar to that of the linear regression model, which is reassuring. However, in fitting the best params by method of hyper parameters, the conclusion is clear that the random forest regressor has a better fitted model based on the mean absolute error yielding a $1 better prediction than the linear regression model. \n",
    "\n",
    "A side note from the random forest model is that the best parameters were n estimator of 69, imputer of median and no scaling. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also answer the question of do we have enough data to soundly make a decision or is more data needed? The answer is validated by use of 'learning_curve' from sklearn, which allows us to run the pipe for different amount of data. We see that after 40-50 sample sizes, the benefits of more data begin to plateau. \n",
